The streets around Victoria Station offer hotels to suit all budgets.","shortDistanceGroup":{"label":"Less than 0.5 miles","groupDestinations":["Benjamin Franklin House - 100 yards","London Charing Cross Station - 200 yards","Embankment Station - 200 yards","Charing Cross Station - 200 yards","Charing Cross - 300 yards","Nelson's Column - 300 yards","Banqueting House - 300 yards","Cleopatra's Needle - 300 yards","Victoria Embankment Gardens - 300 yards","City Center - 300 yards"]},"longDistanceGroup":{"label":"3+ mi","groupDestinations":["London City Airport (LCY) - 7.5 miles","Biggin Hill Airport (BQH) - 14 miles","London Heathrow Airport (LHR) - 14 miles","London Gatwick Airport (LGW) - 24 miles","London Luton Airport - 28 miles","London Stansted Airport (STN) - 31 miles","Farnborough Airport (FAB) - 32 miles","Southend-on-Sea Municipal Airport (SEN) - 36 miles","Shoreham-By-Sea Airport (ESH) - 47 miles"]},"distanceGroupsAll":[{"label":"Less than 0.5 miles","groupDestinations":["Benjamin Franklin House - 100 yards","London Charing Cross Station - 200 yards","Embankment Station - 200 yards","Charing Cross Station - 200 yards","Charing Cross - 300 yards","Nelson's Column - 300 yards","Banqueting House - 300 yards","Cleopatra's Needle - 300 yards","Victoria Embankment Gardens - 300 yards","City Center - 300 yards"]},{"label":"3+ mi","groupDestinations":["London City Airport (LCY) - 7.5 miles","Biggin Hill Airport (BQH) - 14 miles","London Heathrow Airport (LHR) - 14 miles","London Gatwick Airport (LGW) - 24 miles","London Luton Airport - 28 miles","London Stansted Airport (STN) - 31 miles","Farnborough Airport (FAB) - 32 miles","Southend-on-Sea Municipal Airport (SEN) - 36 miles","Shoreham-By-Sea Airport (ESH) - 47 miles"]}],"mobileGoogleMapLink":"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.506841,-0.12435","geoloc":{"lat":51.506841,"lng":-0.12435}},"featuredReview":{"recommendedBy":"Reviewed by William of Ankara","hasSubject":true,"subject":"Corinthia Hotel in April","rating":5,"qualitativeBadgeText":"Outstanding","postedOn":1431421786000,"tripType":"Trip type: Romance","recommended":"This hotel is <strong>Recommended<\/strong>","title":"Corinthia Hotel in April","summary":"We stayed three nights in the Corinthia Hotel in Apirl, 2015. This was a very well appointed hotel. The staff was very friendly and courteous answering all of our questions and helping us when we needed it. The location is great, about a two minute walk to the Embankment stop of the underground, from which you can reach all the other important areas of London. The hotel was also within walking distance of many important sites: the houses of parliament, trafalgar square, liecester square, picadilly circus, the london eye and many others. Overall we were very satisfied with our stay here.","reviewedBy":"Reviewed by William of Ankara on May 12, 2015","hotelService":5,"hotelCondition":5,"roomComfort":5,"roomCleanliness":5,"reviewType":"hr"},"welcomeRewards":{"welcomeRewardsMessage":"For every 10 nights, get 1 free*!","welcomeRewardsFootNote":"*A free* night does not include taxes and fees.
